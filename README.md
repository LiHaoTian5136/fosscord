# wtf is this?

this is fosscord's last version of test client from feburary 2023 :p

i will be doing bug fixes and such but eh whatever

all i know right now is that statuses are kinda broken cause of the client scraping? (someone correct me on that)

# how i run this?

i used nvm to install node (nvm install --lts)

after you get node run these following commands:
```
npm i
npm run build
npm run generate:schema
npm run generate:client
npm start
```
this will start the client and you can access it on localhost:3001
